- Socks, balled up and clean OR a balled strip of fabric (also referred to as a "sock").
    - The only thing allowed in a sock is another sock and a piece of paper to identify the owner.
    - Socks cannot be chained together, or made into a melee weapon of any kind.
    - Balled fabric "socks" need to be presented to an admin before use.
- Players are encouraged to carry water with them, to apply sunscreen, and to wear comfortable running shoes at all times.
- Transport
    - Players are required to move about on foot as far as possible while in the Play Zones.
    - During missions, players may only travel on foot.
    - During the rest of the game, players are requested to park cars, or leave other wheeled vehicles, in safe locations and travel campus on foot as far as possible.
    - Players in any form of wheeled transportation (cars, bicycles, skateboards, motorcycles, etc.) are considered out of play until they have come to a complete stop and entered a Play Zone safely.

Play Zone Rules
- The game is to be played on campus only, bounded by Somerset Street and African Street.
- In Play Zones, the game is assumed to continue at all times throughout the week of play, unless otherwise specified by the Admin team.
- Areas where play is not allowed are divided into four categories for clarity.
- No Play Zones
    - Areas off campus, bounded by African and Somerset Streets.
    - Indoor areas, or any place where the sky is obscured by a constructed roof or ceiling.
    - Mandatory academic or society/sport events while they are in progress. Play continues up until these events commence, and begins once they have finished.
    - Botanical Gardens.
- Safe zones
    - Areas specifically demarcated by the Admin team.
    - A 3m radius around Admin or Moderator facilitated Supply Drops. Zombies should not enter these areas to avoid confusion.
    - The Kaif and Library stairs, marked out by the Admin Team.
- Transitional zones
    - These are unavoidable areas where the safety of players or non-players may be compromised: stairs, parking lots, and 2m from doorways.
    - Players are required to move through these zones immediately, suspending play while they do so. These zones cannot be occupied as ‘safe’ for human players, or used for ambushes by zombie players.
- Dead zones
    - These are all roads. Play in roads is strictly prohibited, enforced by a permanent ban from this and all other RU HvZ events.
    - Players should announce intention to cross the road, in which case they must cross immediately when it is safe to do so, and resume play on the other side of the road when it is safe to do so.
    - A zombie MAY NOT tag a human waiting to cross the road.

Human Rules:
- Players on the Human team must wear their bandannas clearly on their upper arm when in a Play Zone. A bandanna can only be taken off when in a No Play Zone
- Humans can only defend themselves with approved sock or cloth projectiles. No other form of defence of any kind will be tolerated.
- Humans must play for the benefit of their side only, giving away no information to the zombie team deliberately.
- If directly asked whether they are playing on the Human team, players are required to answer honestly or to say nothing.
    - Players cannot lie and claim to be on the other team or say they are not playing.

Zombie Rules
- Zombie players wear their bandannas around their heads when in Play Zones. Bandannas can only be adjusted in No Play Zones.
- Zombies cannot carry socks or other tools. They may only tag players with their hands, and are free to run, hide, and move however they wish to on foot.
- Zombies must answer honestly if asked what team they are on, or remain silent. They cannot lie and claim to be a human or claim not to be playing.

Stunning Rules
- A human may stun a zombie only with an approved projectile thrown by hand.
- A zombie is stunned if hit cleanly by a projectile on the body. Headshots do not count.
- Stunned zombies must immediately place their bandannas around their necks, and wait for their stun time (initially 20 minutes) to expire before replacing their bandannas around their heads inside a No-Play Zone.
- Stunned zombies cannot interact in the game in any way until their stun time is over.
- Humans may stun zombies who are outside of Safe Zones, but only if they intend on leaving the Safe Zone as if it were a Transitional Zone.
- Humans are encouraged to call out when their projectiles hit to avoid conflicts. Honest from both sides is expected.
- A stunned zombie cannot be stunned again to reset the stun time.
- Stun disputes must be taken as soon as possible to a Moderator or Admin.

Tagging Rules
- A zombie may only tag a human with a clean, firm touch to the body. 
- Any inappropriate touching or violent tagging will not be tolerated.
- A zombie may tag a human in a Safe Zone, only if the zombie can make the tag with both feet firmly outside of the Safe Zone.
- Zombies may only tag one human at a time, stopping to collect the Human’s HvZ ID card before continuing to play.
- The tag must be logged on the website as soon as possible, with a 15 minute leeway unless there are extenuating circumstances such as a lecture. It is assumed that if you have time to make the tag, you have time to log the tag.
- For the 15 minutes of waiting time, the tagged Human is treated as “Incubating”, moving their bandanna to their wrist for this period.
- Incubating humans are treated as human until they turn.
- A tag on a human’s backpack or loose clothing is not considered a successful tag.
- Tag disputes must be taken as soon as possible to a Moderator or Admin.

Game Structure
STAGE 1: OUTBREAK 6.00-14.00 on Monday
The original zombie (OZ), chosen from a willing pool of players before the game begins, starts tagging humans. During this period the OZ is the only zombie allowed to wear a bandanna as if they were a human player. Tagging rules still apply, but the OZ cannot be stunned. All other zombies created by the OZ follow the normal zombie rules.

STAGE 2: APOCALYPSE (14.00 on Monday – 17.00 on Friday)
From 14.00 on Monday, the OZ places their bandanna as per a normal zombie, and game proceeds as above and all rules are in effect.

Humans are obliged to attend one of two supply drops every day, happening from 12.00-14.00 and 16.00-17.00. These will be in different locations every day, messaged to human players prior to the drop. You will be checked off on our system, and players not attending will be removed from the game. Attending these may earn in game points or rewards.

On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, starting at 19.00 there will be a mission. All players are encouraged to attend, as missions will result in rewards for the teams, and depending on the outcomes of each mission the storyline and final victory conditions will radically change. During missions, game variables including safe zones, certain no-play zones, and other variables may be changed for each individual mission’s duration ONLY. Missions must be completed on foot only.

STAGE 3: THE FINAL SHOWDOWN (19.00 on Friday)
Gameplay is suspended from 17.00 on Friday. The surviving humans are safe until the final mission starts at 19.00 on Friday. Depending on the performance of both teams, the nature of this final mission will change, but the ultimate outcome is determined on the battlefield.
